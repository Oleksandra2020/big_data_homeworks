AskeBay,2022-06-02 10:47:51.113764,@119526 If a buyer has a negative feedback for not paying it's not going to stop them from bidding on your item. If you set up buyer requirements correctly you can restrict them from bidding if they've had an unpaid item case: https://t.co/5GCQb0r3Is. ^BC
119526,2022-06-02 10:47:51.216164,"@AskeBay So maybe they’re restricted in the future, maybe not? And as a seller I have no idea how reliable a buyer is? Yea that’s a horrible setup."
AskeBay,2022-06-02 10:47:51.317410,@119526 I appreciate it is frustrating but leaving a negative feedback won't stop them from doing it again. If you open an unpaid item case they will receive a strike for non payment which can lead to restrictions from bidding in future. ^BC
119526,2022-06-02 10:47:51.422162,Hey @115937 It's crazy to me that you can't leave negative feedback on a buyer that never contacts you or makes any effort to pay for an auction. It only makes more work for me to chase them around and relist.
