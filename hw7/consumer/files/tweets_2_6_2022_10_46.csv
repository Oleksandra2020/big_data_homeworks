sainsburys,2022-06-02 10:46:38.006284,"@119319 Hi Kilf, I'm afraid our mixed weight eggs are cheaper because they're weight and size is not consistent throughout the pack and they're more randomly selected. Aisha"
119319,2022-06-02 10:46:38.108166,@sainsburys That's the point it's a good thing. You wouldn't ask your chicken's to lay uniform egg's or expect them to 🤸

119319,2022-06-02 10:46:38.314740,So @sainsburys mixed size free range eggs are 40p+ a box cheaper than sized eggs. If you had 🐔  chicken's you wouldn't know what size the eggs were going to be surely?
