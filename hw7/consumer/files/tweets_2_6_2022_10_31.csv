Completely irresponsible and utmost negligent on Pilots behalf
AmericanAir,2022-06-02 10:31:49.771419,@116569 We're sorry for the delay. The previous pilot may not have been aware of the problem. We appreciate your patience.
116569,2022-06-02 10:31:49.874671,"@AmericanAir stuck on flight 609 in Charlotte over 55 minutes due to a computer card tech issue while pilot repeatedly advised it would only take a ""few minutes"" to fix. Why wasn't this issue reported by previous pilot that arrived minutes b4 we boarded in effort to save time?"

116571,2022-06-02 10:31:50.481631,@AmericanAir So I assume nothing is coming from tho incident. It has been several days since we made a complaint at the desk in person after the flight and this tweet. Pretty much you blew off any concernnto a act of battery on the plane against a child. This is ridiculous!!!

116573,2022-06-02 10:31:51.093703,@AmericanAir I had to end my trip way sooner than expected. :( Bought a new flight because it was way cheaper than changing my return. What do I need to do to cancel my return so someone can have that seat?
